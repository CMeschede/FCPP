\description{
Function that generates a marked point process \eqn{(JJ[i], WW[i]), i = 1,...,n}.
The JJ\link{i} is the i-th mark and WW\link{i} is the waiting time between the (i-1)-th and
i-th event. The marks (JJ\link{i}) form a MAR-process which is a stationary time series
with extremal index \eqn{\theta \in (0,1]}.
The generated process fulfills all assumptions so that the inter-exceedance times (IETs)
are asymptotically mixture distributed with the dirac measure at point zero and the
Mittag-Leffler distribution as parts.
The IETs are the times between two consequtive extremes which are identified
by the peak-over-threshold (POT) method.

\details{
The event magnitudes/ marks (JJ) form a max-autoregressive(MAR)-process.
This process is stationary with extremal index \eqn{\theta}.

The waiting times (WWs) are i.i.d. and stochastically independent to the
event magnitudes (JJ).
The waiting time distribution can be chosen as "\code{stable}", "\code{ML}" or
"\code{pareto}".

If \code{wait_dist = "stable"}, the \code{stability} parameter \eqn{\alpha} has to be in
the interval (0,1].
In case of \eqn{\alpha < 1}, the WWs are stable distributed with stability parameter \eqn{\alpha}.
Then, the distribution is heavy-tailed in the sense that mean and variance do
not exist.
In this case \code{WW} are generated using the package \code{stabledist}.
In the special case of \code{stability = 1}, the waiting times are equidistant equal \eqn{\sigma},
since the stable distribution converges in distribution to the degenerative dirac measure in \eqn{\sigma}.

If \code{wait_dist = "ML"}, the \code{stability} parameter \eqn{\alpha} has to be in
the interval (0,1].
The WWs are Mittag-Leffler distributed with stability/tail parameter \eqn{\alpha}.
For \eqn{\alpha < 1} the distribution is heavy-tailed in the sense that mean
and variance do not exist.
In case of \eqn{\alpha = 1}, the Mittag-Leffler distribution corresponds to
an exponential distribution with rate \eqn{1/\sigma}.
For the data generation of the Mittag-Leffler distribution
the package \code{MittagLeffleR} is used.

If \code{wait_dist = "pareto"}, the \code{stability} parameter \eqn{\alpha}
has to be in \eqn{(0, \infty)/{1}}.
If \eqn{\alpha < 1}, a Pareto distribution with shape parameter \eqn{\alpha}
and scale parameter \eqn{(1/(\Gamma(1-\alpha))^{1/\alpha} * \sigma} is used.
Then the distribution is heavy-tailed in the sense that mean and variance do not exist.
If \eqn{\alpha > 1}, the scale parameter becomes \eqn{(\alpha-1)/\alpha * \sigma}.
For \eqn{\alpha > 1}, the expected value exists and equals \eqn{\sigma}. For \eqn{\alpha > 2}
the variance exists additionally.
For the generation of the Pareto distribution the Package \code{ReIns} is used.

For all three waiting time distributions with \code{stability} parameter \eqn{\alpha < 1}
it holds that they are in the domain of attraction of the stable distribution
which is a positively skewed sum-stable distribution.

The generated process (JJ,WW) fulfills all assumptions so that the inter-exceedance times (IETs)
are asymptotically mixture distributed with the dirac measure at point zero and the
Mittag-Leffler distribution as parts.
The IETs are the times between two consequtive extremes which are identified
by the peak-over-threshold (POT) method.
